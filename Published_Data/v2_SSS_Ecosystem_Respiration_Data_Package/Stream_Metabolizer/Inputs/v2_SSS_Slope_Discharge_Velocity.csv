# COMID; N/A; N/A; Common identifier (COMID) identified using NHDPlus version 2 and used to extract geospatial variables.,,,,
# Slope; N/A; N/A; Extracted from the national hydrography dataset (NHD).,,,,
# Discharge; cubic_meters_per_second; N/A; Extracted from NOAA National Water Model (NWM) retrospective dataset using version 2.1 of NWM. The dataset provides a 42-year (February 1979 through December 2020) hourly simulation at all sampling locations. We computed the monthly averaged streamflow and velocity in August across these simulation years.,,,,
