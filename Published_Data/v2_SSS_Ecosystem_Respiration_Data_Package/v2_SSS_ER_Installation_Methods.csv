InstallationMethod_ID,InstallationMethod_Description
BaroInterp_01,Data is interpolated from regression using all measured pressure data from study and elevation. Sensor is deployed at the end of a short rope (2-3 feet) and hung from a tree branch as close to the sampling location as possible.
Depth_01,"A time series of the average depth of the reach was created in two steps. First, the average depth of the stream reach was measured via transects, sonar, or public sources. This created a reach-average depth at a single point in time. In order to convert this into a time series, we used a water pressure datalogger and a local barometric pressure logger to estimate depth. Barometric pressure was subtracted from absolute pressure to get water pressure, which was then converted to depth at a single-point in the stream. The difference between the reach-average depth at a single point in time and the single-point depth at the reference time (time at which reach depth was measured via transect, sonar, or public sources) was used as the depth offset. This offset was subtracted from the single-point depth timeseries to create the reach depth time series."
ManualChamberDark_02,Open channel respiration is estimated by deploying triplicate two liter dark bottle incubations in brown Nalgene bottles for 90 minutes at each site. First a 20-minute equilibration period is set up by (1) rinsing two liter bottles three times with river water; (2) submerging them; (3) filling with river water;  and then (4) capping underwater to prevent water bubbles from entering the bottles. The bottles; sensors; and boat motors are then placed in the river and secured using bricks or larger rocks nearby for the equilibration period. Following the equilibration period the bottles were (1) emptied; (2) refilled with river water; and while still submerged (3) a miniDOT Logger and a small boat motor is inserted in each of three two liter bottles. The bottles are then capped and placed in the river and secured using bricks or larger rocks nearby for 70 minutes.
Minidot_03,Sensor is deployed with a copper kit installed to minimize biofilm colonization on the sensor window. Sensor is attached to two bricks along with a HOBO depth sensor and deployed on the riverbed.
