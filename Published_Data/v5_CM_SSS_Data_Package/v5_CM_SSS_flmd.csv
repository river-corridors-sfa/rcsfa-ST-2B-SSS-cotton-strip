A ""p"" in the IAT indicates ""point"" (e.g., 2p5 = 2.5; p01 = 0.01). Each sample has three replicates. During solid phase extraction (SPE), FTICR-MS samples were diluted to achieve a  standard NPOC concentration of 1.5 milligrams carbon per liter. For theses sediment samples (labeled with “SED” in the sample name), the sediment NPOC values were used for this calculation (labeled with “SED” in the sample name). For example, CM_001_SED-1 NPOC values were used to determine the dilution for CM_001_SED-1.
